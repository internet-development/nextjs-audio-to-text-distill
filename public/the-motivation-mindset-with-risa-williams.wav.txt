 And now for another episode
 on getting things done
 without all the stress.
 Hello, everyone, and welcome
 to The Motivation Mindset.
 I'm joined today by a very
 special guest, Dr. Alexis
 Hope, who runs Focus Space,
 which I am
 a big fan of and I've
 partnered with before.
 They're a great company for
 people who need to find their
 focus in a community.
 Welcome, Alexis, to the show.
 Thank you, Risa.
 I'm super glad to talk to you
 because we've had you as a
 guest a few times at Focus
 Space,
 and I feel like you and I are
 always talking in a big group
 of people.
 So I'm super excited to have
 this one-on-one time with you
.
 I'm so happy you're here, and
 I'm so excited I get to have
 you share some of your own
 productivity
 and time management tools
 because I know you do so much
.
 You run Focus Space.
 You also have a band.
 You also spent a decade at
 MIT where Dr. Alexis was a
 National Science Foundation
 graduate research
 fellow and received your PhD
 at the MIT Media Lab.
 Even just reading your
 LinkedIn, I'm like, oh, my
 God, this is across so many
 different
 fields.
 And you're telling me all the
 different various hats you
 wear and jobs you do.
 And I was asking you, how do
 you even describe what you do
 to other people?
 Is it hard?
 Because you are very much an
 expert in many different
 categories of things.
 It is hard sometimes.
 I usually use the catch-all
 term designer and then
 digging from there about
 where that
 means.
 And luckily, that discipline
 is kind of broad enough to
 cover a lot of different
 things.
 But yeah.
 And then, you know, there's
 lots of different projects.
 But I really try to see the
 interrelationships between a
 lot of them.
 Maybe it only makes sense in
 my mind, but I try.
 I think it's so true of so
 many of the people I work
 with as well.
 They're so highly intelligent
 and high achievers.
 And they're doing things
 across so many different,
 almost unrelated fields.
 But they somehow find a
 through line throughout all
 of that.
 And I know when we were
 talking before I started
 recording, you were saying
 your through line is
 finding the fun, which I can
 really relate to.
 If I can't find the fun in
 something I'm doing, I don't
 usually have the energy or
 willpower
 to engage in it.
 And maybe that's true of you,
 too.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 I mean, yeah, I definitely j
uggle a lot of things.
 But I certainly have my
 moments and eras of not doing
 anything and feeling unmotiv
ated.
 I'm in long stretches of that
, you know.
 And I definitely think that I
've learned that I'm best when
 I can find that internal
 motivation
 through fun, through weaving
 joy and play into my day,
 through focusing on
 relationships with
 the people that I'm working
 with.
 That's super important to me.
 And then the kind of values
 and mission behind it as well
.
 Yeah.
 So it's like everyday,
 everyday joy, plus some of
 those deeper things that keep
 me going.
 Otherwise, I'm very prone to,
 you know, long stretches of
 doing nothing, to be honest.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think that's really
 relatable for most of us.
 How was Focus Space born?
 Was it born out of the idea
 that you wanted to provide
 that for other people when
 they're
 feeling unmotivated?
 I actually joined Focus Space
 right after it was created.
 So my co-founder and our CEO,
 Nadira, she's amazing.
 So speaking of relationships,
 that's what drew me into
 Focus Space.
 She's an old friend of mine.
 She started Focus Space prior
 to the pandemic, actually, as
 an in-person experience.
 So for those of you who don't
 know, Focus Space is a body
 doubling and accountability
 and
 community.
 We help people put a lot of
 what Risa talks about into
 practice.
 So that's why we've had her
 as a guest several times to
 our community.
 So Nadira created it as an in
-person experience.
 She rented out yoga studios
 part-time during the day and
 at night when people, when
 they weren't
 having classes and brought in
 facilitators and some tables
 and chairs.
 And it was kind of like an
 adult study hall vibe.
 And part of what motivated
 her was kind of this
 experience many of us might
 have.
 You know, if you're at a
 coffee shop and you, you know
, see other people working on
 their
 laptops and you kind of like
 follow suit and do the same.
 That's sort of the magic of
 what's called body doubling.
 But she also noticed that,
 you know, she's in that space
.
 She was doing that, but then
 also tending to get
 distracted.
 So she kind of thought like,
 oh, what if there were a
 place where I could go where
 I knew I
 would always get my work done
.
 But it still had that same
 kind of cozy, inviting feel
 that a coffee shop.
 So yeah, Nadira invited me to
 join and I just kind of fell
 in love with the project and
 the
 community.
 And having had my own
 struggles with getting things
 done, I used some early
 prototype of
 focus space to actually
 finish my PhD.
 So I was sold and then I had
 to keep on going.
 And it's been, and then our
 third, you know, co-founder
 came on, Justin, who Nadira
 worked
 with at Twitter.
 And just, yeah, the three of
 us plus our really, really
 badass team.
 And just, we just love it.
 And now people can join
 online and it's like an
 online thing you sign up for
 and everybody's
 working on different things,
 but at the same time.
 So it kind of builds
 accountability into people's
 weekly routine where there's
 a structure.
 I think that's really great
 for people working at home.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Because the way we've all
 worked has changed
 dramatically over the last
 few years, you know,
 the rise of remote and
 flexible work and rising
 rates of entrepreneurship and
 freelancing
 too.
 So that structure and support
 is really important.
 But coming back to what we
 were talking about around
 like joy and play, it can
 also be monotonous,
 right?
 To kind of every day work at
 your computer.
 So it's important to us to
 bring to our community this
 sense of aliveness and joy
 and play too.
 So, yeah.
 That's kind of what I like
 about partnering with you is
 there is a sort of playful
 vibe going
 on.
 And when I do presentations
 to the group there, there's
 just so much fun in the room
 and people
 are, you know, chatting and
 talking about stuff related
 to it.
 But you can see that you've
 done a good job creating
 connection with a group of
 strangers,
 you know, basically you are
 meeting online.
 It's really, really cool.
 I think that's why your book
 resonates so much with
 everyone because it is, it is
 probably
 one of the most, you know,
 playful, approachable
 productivity books I've ever
 read.
 Yeah, getting stuff done
 without the stress.
 And also the Procrastination
 Playbook, I love that one.
 It reminded me of like a
 choose your own adventure
 book.
 Yeah.
 Really that I used to read as
 a kid, you know, you've got
 this particular challenge, go
 to
 page 47.
 I know.
 And I really love that.
 It's really.
 I used to love those books.
 I don't know about you, but
 those are my favorite growing
 up.
 And I'd skip, I'd like try to
 find the best ending.
 Yeah, same, same, same, R.L.
 Stein and all those.
 Exactly.
 But I figure it gets you into
 the mindset of this isn't so
 bad.
 I could make it a game.
 I don't have to take it so
 seriously because these
 subjects like procrastination
 or motivation
 or getting things done, they
 feel so heavy to people.
 And there's a lot of guilt
 and shame built in.
 Yes.
 Well, we can make it lighter
 and we can see the positive
 aspect of that, too.
 Like these things can be fun.
 It can be more fun doing it
 together.
 I've had clients even use the
 body doubling with organizing
 their closet.
 Just invite a friend over and
 have them sit around with you
 and talk to you while you're
 doing it, even if they're not
 participating in the
 organizing.
 Just having someone else
 there is such a warm feeling.
 And it often creates that
 time parameter of, OK, I need
 to do this.
 This person's here.
 So this thing will get done
 in this period of time, which
 I think in our modern age, we
're
 lacking a little bit,
 especially for those of us
 working at home.
 It kind of just feels like we
 have endless free time to do
 stuff.
 But it's an illusion because
 it isn't really free and it's
 not endless.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 In our heads, it often feels
 like that.
 So I like this idea of
 incorporating fun.
 Give me some more examples of
 how you bring in fun and play
 to your everyday routine,
 which
 can sometimes feel monotonous
.
 Yeah.
 Um, I guess I think about it
 at like a different,
 different scales, I guess.
 Um, for example, you know,
 with focus space, a lot of
 what we do is, um, you know,
 we're
 building an app to go along
 with, with everything, all of
 the live body doubling
 sessions.
 Um, so there's a lot of work
 on like, you know, designing
 a new feature.
 That's like a big thing, kind
 of stressful because you want
 to get it right.
 And, you know, when we have a
 limited engineering team, so
 our prioritization and
 decisions are
 really important.
 It's kind of like a heavy
weight thing to decide to
 spend a lot of, you know, our
 resources on
 that.
 So I just, for that kind of
 thing, like, you know, that
 is very stressful, feels like
 a big responsibility, but I
 just really try to connect
 with the kind of joy of
 getting
 to do that with my team who I
 really love and respect.
 And we also have a lot of fun
 together.
 Um, you know, so I just think
 about like the jokes we'll
 share along the way and the
 pride
 we're going to feel together
 once we hit these milestones.
 So I think that's, you know,
 a big part of it, like the,
 who you're doing things with,
 and
 we can't always control that,
 you know, sometimes we have
 teammates or, you know,
 companies where
 the culture's not like that,
 but if at all possible, you
 know, if you're able to find
 ways
 to share the joy and play
 with the people that you're
 working with and try to find
 ways
 to cut through the intensity
 to find joy together, I think
 that's helpful.
 Yeah.
 So that's kind of like a big
 scale thing.
 And then like at a minor
 scale, I can't believe I'm
 going to admit this on a
 podcast, but I
 do have a very silly
 technique that I do to get
 through a computer work that
 I don't want
 to do.
 It's called the foot bath
 method.
 So, okay.
 So, um, I will like, if I
 have like emails to go
 through or like, you know, I
 really
 need to sit at my computer
 and go through like a bunch
 of stuff that I might not
 want to do.
 I will make a little like
 foot bath for myself under my
 desk and, you know, bath
 salts in there
 or whatever.
 And what that does is one, it
 traps me there.
 You can't physically get up.
 That's right.
 And also like, it feels good.
 So I think like sensory
 pleasures are like, are
 really important, you know,
 like light
 that candle, use a foot bath,
 you know, have that tea.
 I think you wrote about this
 in your book, like connecting
 to the feelings part of the
 goal.
 And I love to like also
 connect to the feelings part
 of the process, you know,
 like make it
 enjoyable.
 I know.
 I have something similar.
 It's so funny you say that.
 I have one of those under the
 desk ellipticals that moves
 your feet.
 You don't really have to do
 anything, but it moves your
 feet.
 That's cool.
 And I use it when I'm writing
 because it's the only way I
 can stay put and focus on
 writing.
 And it goes in a cycle of
 like 30 minutes.
 So I know if it's done, it's
 been 30 minutes and I've been
 trapped there, right?
 Oh, that's cool too.
 So it's almost like a Pomod
oro method, but using my feet.
 Or how to trap yourself into
 where it can be your next
 book.
 I like using sensory
 techniques to, you know, calm
 the nervous system down
 because what's
 happening is our stress is sp
iking.
 We have to do this task we
 don't want to do and our body
 is rejecting it and saying, I
'd
 rather do anything than be
 here.
 So we need to soothe our
 nervous system into the task
 and soothe our brain by
 saying nice
 things or like you're saying,
 connect with the feeling
 place you want to get to.
 So what I'm hearing when you
're talking is you're
 naturally doing that somehow.
 You're either naturally
 connecting to, oh, this is
 going to be so much fun.
 I get to work with this
 person I really like and we
're going to have a great time
.
 Or you're connecting to like
 the finished product and how
 good that's going to feel to
 you to
 share that with people.
 So there's always this like
 you're directing your brain
 to the feeling place and then
 it's
 easier to get yourself on
 board with doing the hard
 task that you have to do to
 get there.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 You said that the hats method
 resonated with you from the
 book.
 And for those of you
 listening, the hats method is
 where you picture an
 imaginary hat for every
 single role you have to do.
 So someone like Alexis has so
 many roles.
 She's switching all day long.
 And the idea would be like
 every time you're going into
 the next segment of time,
 like whether
 she's a founder of a company
 or she's working on her band
 or whatever, you would put a
 different
 hat on, which is like a
 mental gear that you're
 imagining.
 And it gets you locked into
 that moment of what am I
 doing for this next segment
 of time
 and kind of draws your
 attention into the present
 moment.
 Yeah, that one resonated with
 me super well because I've
 always been accused of
 wearing too many hats and
 also burning the candle at
 both ends.
 Both of those metaphors have
 been tied to me.
 But definitely, I mean, like
 with running a company, you
 sort of have to wear a ton of
 different hats,
 especially a small company
 like ours, you know, so in a
 given day, everything from,
 like I said,
 designing new features to
 marketing to team meetings to
...
 So sometimes you're
 presenting, right?
 So sometimes you're the
 public figure out there.
 Yes, yes, right.
 And that's a different hat,
 right?
 Totally.
 And each of those requires
 like a different, different
 energy.
 Well, so I guess, yeah, the
 hats method, when I read that
, I was like, oh, like, it's
 okay to have a lot of hats.
 You're both kind of gaining
 permission, but like, what is
 key then is just to kind of
 be like, you know,
 a little bit more intentional
 and just take a pause for a
 moment and think about like,
 which of those hats am I
 wearing now?
 And what do I need to do to
 best support, you know, the
 person who's wearing that hat
?
 And for me, the idea of a
 couple of things, space,
 where I am.
 So usually like, you know, if
 I'm home, like I am right now
 talking to you,
 I will have, you know, more
 meetings and more focused,
 thoughtful work if I'm going
 to.
 And then usually the afterno
ons, I'll go into my co-
working space.
 And then I have a different
 set of expectations around
 what I'm going to be able to
 do there versus at home.
 So I don't expect myself to
 do the same kind of focus
 test here is there.
 And then also having a
 reminder to kind of like have
 boundaries around the certain
 roles and tasks.
 You know, if I'm wearing my
 focus space hat, then I am
 maybe silencing notifications
 for other projects that I'm
 involved with.
 Like setting expectations
 with people that I work with
 on other, on the different
 projects.
 And I'm not available from
 these times because I'm, I
 haven't said this to them,
 but maybe I should.
 But I'm like wearing this
 other hat.
 Right.
 I find that it just makes me
 more effective at the thing
 that I'm doing.
 And you, you know, you kind
 of, I think talking about the
 hats method is also like
 being a way to help promote
 presence in the thing that
 you're doing.
 Yeah.
 How I think about it.
 I love that.
 I love that idea of
 protecting that hat you're
 wearing a little more.
 It could even go with when
 you're with your friends or
 like when I'm with my kids
 and I have the mom hat on.
 It's so tempting to be
 checking my phone or
 answering a client email.
 But I have to remember I'm
 here with my kids at the park
.
 Like this is what I'm doing
 now.
 I'm a mom right now.
 I cannot, I have to separate
 the workout or else they'll
 never get the full me.
 You know, the work will never
 get the full me.
 I'll be kind of split down
 the middle.
 And probably for someone like
 you, you need to be there
 with your full attention, you
 know?
 Yeah, totally.
 And that said, I think there
 are times I also, I think
 maybe this is like the ADHD
 minded kind of self, but
 looking for or not even
 looking just, you know,
 connections between things
 will jump out to me too.
 So it's not like sometimes I
 don't want to keep all these
 roles super, super separate
 because sometimes like, oh, I
'm doing this in this project.
 And that person should meet
 this person and this could be
 a collaboration.
 And that actually does make
 the work easier and better.
 But I think the key is that
 being an intentional choice.
 Yeah, sometimes you'll wear
 two at once, but you don't
 want to do that all the time
 or else your energy will be
 zero.
 And sometimes you don't want
 to wear any hat.
 Like sometimes you just want
 to go out in the world and
 enjoy it and not think about
 any of your roles.
 Yes, that reminds me of, yeah
, a lot of what you were
 discussing in your book
 around downtime and
 creativity.
 It was like future meal as an
 artist, designer, creative
 type.
 Yeah.
 Letting your brain have time
 to wander is so important.
 So important for our brain.
 That's when we get our best
 ideas sometimes.
 Totally.
 And I think, you know, we
 have a lot of us feel guilty
 about that because we feel
 like we should be filling
 every available time with
 something, quote unquote,
 productive or we're a failure
.
 But I really would, really
 would encourage everybody to
 protect your bloating brain
 time as much as possible.
 And that goes back to our
 original point, which is
 protect your fun a little
 more.
 See fun as part of the
 balance that you need to feel
 a sense of well-being.
 So it's not, oh, I'm having
 fun.
 I shouldn't be because I
 should be working.
 It's like, no, both are
 important.
 I think that's what we're
 saying.
 And there is a way, as Alexis
 has demonstrated, to weave it
 together into your workday so
 that you're getting that
 balance your brain needs.
 So at the end of the day, you
 don't feel so burnt out and
 worn down.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 I just wanted to ask you to
 share your fun tool that you
 invented.
 Can you share that with
 everyone?
 This is one of the tools that
 helped me out when I was
 finishing my PhD along with
 focus space sessions.
 It sounds really simple when
 I say it, but it was super
 powerful for me.
 I just wrote down on a post-
it note, what if this were
 easy?
 And put it on my wall.
 And every day that helped me
 just make a little bit of
 progress.
 And it was very freeing in
 the end.
 I love that.
 Oh, and then I wrote, what if
 this were fun on another one?
 Yeah, that's a good one, too.
 I think I ask myself that a
 lot.
 What if this were fun?
 How could I make it more fun?
 How could I make it more easy
?
 And what if it were easy?
 Because we're always thinking
 the opposite.
 What if it's hard and a
 disaster?
 And it's just teasing your
 brain to consider other
 options.
 Yeah.
 So I like that.
 Stick it on a post-it.
 Put it up.
 Sometimes the simplest tools
 work the best because that's
 all we need to make the
 mindset shift in that
 difficult moment.
 Thank you so much, Alexis.
 I loved all your tools and I
 love talking to you.
 Tell everybody how they can
 find you and what you do.
 Yes.
 Yes.
